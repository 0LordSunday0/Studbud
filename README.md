Assignment 3

This assignment has proven challenging for me. I have had little experience up to this
point designing websites. I am much more comfortable using frameworks and libraries
that do most of the work for you. However, I understand that it is important to know
how to do this from scratch, even if its not as relevant to the industry anymore.

My assignment has undergone a few minor iterations in design. I streamlined the mobile
layout due to time constraints and also used placeholders for the stopwatch and music player.
Given more time (and without other subjects to worry about) I believe I could have made the
design more aesthetically pleasing.

One of the challanges I came across during developement was debugging. At one stage, my code
was appending elements to the wrong div, causing me much frustration. It wasnt until I realised
that I had copied a function from one part of the site to another without changing the name. Of
course, every javascript file on the page is loaded, so two functions with the same name were what
was causing the issue. 

My biggest flaw in the website (despite it being unfinished) is the lack of flow between pages,
it would have been better from a design perspective to keep everything on the same page but in collapsed
sections. Navigating to a different page can be jarring for study apps.

In general, I used the documentation for css and javascript, as well as the lecture materials 
to complete this assignment. Only in one specific instance did I use code from a video.
